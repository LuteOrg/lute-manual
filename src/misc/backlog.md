# Backlog

Lute's backlog is tracked in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/luteorg/lute-v3/issues).

There's also a [GitHub Lute-v3 project](https://github.com/users/jzohrab/projects/1), where I track some other items for the issues like category, priority, and size.  This project will be moved to github.com/luteorg in the future.
