# Backlog

Lute's backlog is tracked in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute-v3/issues).

There's also a [GitHub Lute-v3 project](https://github.com/users/jzohrab/projects/1), where I track some other items for the issues like category, priority, and size, but at present (Dec 2023) I'm not sure how much utility that has.
