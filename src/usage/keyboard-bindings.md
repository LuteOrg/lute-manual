# Key bindings

> Note: Before using the keyboard you must set the focus within the frame by clicking once on the frame.

Some of these actions refer to the "current word" - that's either the word you're hovering over, or have clicked.

## Updating status

You can edit the status of the current word with a keystroke:

| Key            | Set status of marked term(s) to        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| `1` - `5`      | 1 (Learning) to 5 (Learned)            |
| `i`            | "Ignored"                              |
| `w`            | "Well Known"                           |


You can also "bulk update" statuses by holding down Shift and clicking with the mouse.  All of the underlined terms will then be affected when you hit 1, 2, etc.
