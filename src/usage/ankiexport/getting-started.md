# Getting started

> TODO these notes are very rough, fix them up.

Install Anki desktop (if you donâ€™t have it already).

Install and configure the AnkiConnect add-on.

Setting up export is the following steps:

Loot, enable an export, and set the AnkiConnect URL

Test the connect connection

Define an export.

The simplest export possible would be to justify the field mapping, leaving the criteria blank.

Click new mapping, specify, the deck, name, and note type. Usually Anki comes with a simple note type or a basic note type, so choose that, and then choose the front and back field and map some data.

Then go to the term listing, check a term, and click "xxx"  You'll get a message.  Go to Anki, and the card is there.
