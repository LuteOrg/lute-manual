# Getting started

{{#include note.md}}

> TODO these notes are very rough, fix them up.

[Install Anki desktop and AnkiConnect](./anki-and-anki-connect.md)

[Enable exports](./enabling.md)

Define an export.

The simplest export possible would be to justify the field mapping, leaving the criteria blank.

Click new mapping, specify, the deck, name, and note type. Usually Anki comes with a simple note type or a basic note type, so choose that, and then choose the front and back field and map some data.

Then go to the term listing, check a term, and click "xxx"  You'll get a message.  Go to Anki, and the card is there.
