# Exporting terms

{{#include note.md}}

Once Anki and AnkiConnect are set up, and your exports configured, you can export terms from Lute:

* From the reading page, you can click on a word, or shift click multiple words, and then export them using the reading menu.  You can also define a keyboard shortcut for the Anki export if you want.  When the words are exported, you’ll get a message showing which cards have been created.
* From the term listing, click the checkmarks for the terms you want to export, and in the actions menu click export to Anki. You’ll get a message.

(Anki and Anki connect must be running for the export to work, of course :-P)
