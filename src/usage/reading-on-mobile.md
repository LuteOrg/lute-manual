# Reading on mobile

Lute was designed for desktop/laptop usage, but in a pinch you can connect to a running instance[^1] on a mobile device.

While reading, Lute supports the following interactions:

* Tap an unknown term to open the term edit form.
* Tap an existing term to open the term's hover.  Tap that term again to open its edit form.
* Long-tap (press and hold) a term to start a new multi-word term.  The term is highlighted when the long tap is recognized.  Then tap the term at the other end of the multi-word term.  The edit form opens for that new term.  For example, to create the multi-word term "fast as lightning", you'd press and hold "fast" until it highlights, and then you'd tap "lightning".
