# Toggling highlights

On the Settings page is a "Highlight terms by status" checkbox.  If you uncheck that, the term status highlights are removed, except for when you mouseover the term.

Here is the default theme with term highlights:

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="../../assets/usage/themes/toggle_highlights_01.png">

Here is the same, without highlights:

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="../../assets/usage/themes/toggle_highlights_02.png">

If you hover over a term, or cursor through it, the highlight for that term is shown.
