# Defining a language

You can add a new language by going to Settings > Languages.  Your existing languages are listed there.

At the bottom of the page are two links:

## "Load predefined languages and sample stories"

This link leads to a list of over 50 languages predefined in Lute, with sample stories and dictionaries pre-configured.  Click a language and it will be loaded so you can try it out.

(Note: some of these languages require [plugins](../../install/plugins.html))

If the language you're interested in is not present in the predefined languages, you can create a new language with the "Create new" link.

## "Create new"

This link leads to a form for you to define your language.

If your language is similar to one of the predefined languages, you can use that as a "template" by selecting it from the dropdown at the top of the form and clicking "go."

If your language is new, you can check a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iBSwsKI-57HpjnNP8holmk_HDmjh16i5V_G8HJ-oNHY/edit#gid=1003964927) created by the Lute community, which contains many languages and dictionaries.  These are gradually being ported into Lute as volunteers find time.

Then add dictionaries, and you're pretty much set.
