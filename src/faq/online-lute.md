# Is there an online version of Lute?

It's called [LingQ](https://www.lingq.com/). :-)

LingQ is great.  Pay a nominal fee and you get tons of content and a big community of users.  LingQ is also a business, so they have staff, and (hopefully) proper tech support.

Lute will never be online in the way that LingQ is.  While it's possible to build an online company with various cloud providers (AWS, Google, Digital Ocean, etc), running a *proper* company with *unbreakable confidence* requires a great deal of ongoing work:

* scalability
* monitoring and alerting
* security
* backup and restore
* disaster recovery
* ... etc.

Rather than try to go online and compete with existing solutions, Lute opts to emulate the Anki desktop approach: individual user app installs.
