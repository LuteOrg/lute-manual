# Windows

Windows sometimes makes installations more challenging due to OS variants and lack of support for some tech.  Some users have provided more detailed instructions for Windows:

* The YouTube channel is4ndroide made a **fantastic** video on [installing Lute for Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtClbRqBiEM).[^1]
* [Windows 10 (32 bit) using Python and pip](./windows-10-32-bit-using-python.md)
* [Windows using Docker](./windows-using-docker.md)

[^1]: Discord user Keruah noted that you may need to set the Execution Policy for the shell script: "... when you launch the environment script, your Windows may say that you don't have permissions ... open PowerShell, and type `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` to define the policy." -- See [about Execution Policies - PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.4)
